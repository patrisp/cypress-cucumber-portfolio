Feature: Browsing job offers

Scenario: No filters are set by default
    Given I enter the job search page
    Then all offers are displayed by default

Scenario Outline: Job offers are filtered by location and category
    Given I enter the job search page
    When I set the location to <location> and category to <category>
    Then only <category> offers in <location> are displayed

    Examples:
        |   location        |   category    |
